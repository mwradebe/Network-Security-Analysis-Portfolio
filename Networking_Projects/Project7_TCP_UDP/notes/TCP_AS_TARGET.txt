ere is the breakdown of why TCP is such a juicy target for these connection-based attacks.

What does "Anything that requires state can be exhausted" mean?

Think of your computer as a receptionist at a busy hotel.State: The receptionist has a notebook. Every time a guest asks for a room (a connection), the receptionist writes down their name, room number, and status (e.g., "Waiting for check-in").Exhaustion: If 1,000 fake people call the hotel at once and say "I'm coming!", the receptionist fills up every page of the notebook with names of people who will never show up.The Result: When a real guest calls, the receptionist says, "Sorry, my notebook is full, I can't help you." The system is exhausted.Defining the Terms SimplyTermWhat it is in TCPWhy attackers love itStateThe "memory" of a conversation (e.g., Is the handshake finished? Who spoke last?).

Each "state" takes up a slot in a table. Attackers fill these tables with fake conversations.Memory (RAM)Physical space on your computer chip used to store the connection details.If an attacker opens 50,000 "half-connections," they eat up all your RAM until the computer freezes.CPU (Processor)The computer's "brain" used to calculate sequence numbers and verify packets.Verifying thousands of fake handshakes per second makes the "brain" overheat and slow down.Connection TrackingThe system (often a Firewall) that watches every packet to make sure it's part of a real conversation.Firewalls have limits. If you track too many "conversations," the firewall crashes, often leaving the door wide open.Why TCP Is the Target (The "Cost" Asymmetry)This is the secret of cybersecurity: It is much "cheaper" to attack than it is to defend.Low Effort for Attacker: An attacker can send a tiny SYN packet (only 40-60 bytes) from a cheap laptop.High Effort for Server: Your server has to allocate a piece of its memory, generate a sequence number, and start a timer to wait for a reply.

The Math: If 1 attacker sends 1,000 packets, they use almost zero resources. But your server has to use 1,000 slots of memory. If you have 1,000 attackers... the server stands no chance.Common TCP Abuse AttacksSYN Flood: Sending the "Hello" (SYN) but never sending the "Acknowledged" (ACK). Your computer sits there waiting for a "Goodbye" that never comes.TCP Reset (RST) Attack: An attacker sends a fake "Hang up!" packet to a real conversation. It’s like a prankster cutting the phone line while you are talking to your bank.Slowloris: Opening a connection and sending data reeeeally slowly. It keeps the "door" open for a long time, preventing anyone else from using it.Summary for your LabWhen your lab says "Anything that requires state can be exhausted," it is warning you that Organization is a Weakness. Because TCP tries so hard to be reliable and organized (keeping track of everything), it creates a "notebook" that an attacker can fill up with junk.
