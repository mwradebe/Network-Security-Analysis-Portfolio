Ping measures reachability , letency and loss
traceroute maps paths and not performance
ICMP may be blocked intentionally
packet captures confirm command linne claims
Linux provides deeper diagnostic metrics

ping measures latency(time) not bandwidth(speed): ping is like a shout you shout "hello" and wait for the echo
Latency is time it takes to hear the shout

A failed ping doesnt always mean the server is down,  it could mean the server is just ignoring you
ICMP = low priority traffic , mant admins block it 
Ping = tool and ICMP = language
